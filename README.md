# Guix & venv environments for reproducible python development

## Usage
Guix must be installed on the system, see [the guix manual](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html) to do this.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/TimotheeMathieu/guix-env 
guix-env create my_env_name
```

This should create a directory in `~/.guix-env` containing files needed for the environment to run. Note that every file generated by guix-env will be saved into `~/.guix-env`. Then to spawn a shell in the environment, do

```
guix-env shell my_env_name
```

The first run may be a bit slow because of guix downloading a bunch of packages but the second run should be faster as guix cache the packages it uses in `/gnu/store` (remark: don't forget to use `guix gc` to clear the store periodically).

Then, you are good to go and do anything you wish in your environment. You are in a python virtual environment and you can install new python packages with pip. To add new guix package, use `guix-env add my_env_name my_package_name` from outside the environment.


## TODO

- Better documentation
- Tests
- Handle GPU ?
- Feature: rollback, similar to what can be done with guix-home.
